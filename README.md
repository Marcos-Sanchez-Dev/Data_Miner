# Data_Miner
This program is intended to scrape through a PDF file and provide the count of the amount of times a certain phrase/word appears in a document. 

In this example I use the Shakespeare play: Romeo and Juliet. To scrape through the entirety of this PDF and provide a count of the amount of times the word I search
for appears in the text of each individual page. Additionally, a total count of occurrences the word appears in across the play. 

This is minor simulation of simply data scraping for PDF files. This application can be expanded further by using Pandas libraries and other applications to build on 
this and make interactive models.
